# The Journey Begins: Hello World!

## First, The Mission
The mission of this blog is to explore data and answer questions. 
Please be patient with me and I hope we can learn together.

>“I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. 
>That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. 
>That hope always triumphs over experience. 
>That laughter is the only cure for grief. 
>And I believe that love is stronger than death.” -Robert Fulgham

## Getting Started, "Hello World"
 Like every good programming journey, let's begin with "hello world". 

 ```python
 print('hello world')
 ```
I will mainly use python for my analysis.  Code will be made available through 
github and in some cases, through the post.  

Please ask questions!  I am not an expert (yet?) 
and would like to learn with you.  I will do my best to answer every technical question.
